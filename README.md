Understanding the factors affecting mileage per gallon of car

This report includes comprehensive analysis on factors affecting mileage per gallon of car. The data is provided by a struggling car manufacturer who intends to understand what factors are contributing to better mileage among their existing cars and thus build a fuel-efficient car to compete at the highest level in the market. This is a noble cause which can help reduce emission, contributing to better environment consciousness. Various factors like number of cylinders, displacement (measurement of the cylinder volume swept by all the pistons), horsepower (power an engine produces), weight of the car, acceleration, model year, and finally an indicator to determine if the car was US made or not. Using these factors, the business purpose of this report is to determine the mileage per gallon (MPG) of the cars. The number of miles your car can travel on a single gallon of fuel is referred to as fuel efficiency. While "miles per gallon" is a numerical measure, "fuel economy" is a word that describes how well an automobile can use fuel. Thus, measuring the impact on mileage directly relates to fuel economy.
